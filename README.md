# Cosmik M1N1

Cosmik M1N1 is a Minimoog-influenced monophonic voice for the Music Thing
Modular Workshop Computer. It combines two internal band-limited oscillators,
an external OSC3 pitch/CV loop, a four-pole resonant filter, noise, ADS
contours, a free-running LFO, USB MIDI, and Web MIDI preset management.

## Release 1.0.0

Flash `uf2/COSMIK_M1N1_1.0.0.uf2`. The release UF2 is built from the accepted
musical-glide firmware and is accompanied by `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

## Voice

- OSC1 and OSC2 offer triangle, sharktooth, saw, square, wide rectangle, and
  narrow rectangle waveforms. Nine pitch-selected harmonic bands reduce
  aliasing while preserving distinct waveform character.
- Each internal oscillator has a `32'`--`2'` pipe-length range, a seven
  semitone fine range around noon, its own level, and waveform selection.
- External OSC3 uses `CV Out 1` for calibrated pitch, `Audio In 2` as its
  mixer return, and `CV In 2` as an external modulation source. C3 is 0 V,
  matching the Workshop System and Keystep convention.
- `Audio Out 1` is the filtered voice. `Audio Out 2` is the pre-filter mixer.
- White and pink noise have independent level and colour selection.

## Front Panel

- **Middle:** Main is cutoff, X is resonance/emphasis, and Y is filter
  contour.
- **Up:** edits the selected OSC1, OSC2, or external OSC3 page. A short Down
  press cycles the selected oscillator page. Main controls pitch/offset, X
  controls level, and Y selects waveform for internal oscillators or range for
  external OSC3.
- **Down, short hold:** Main is external OSC3 offset, X is MOD DEPTH, and Y is
  pitch/filter modulation balance. MIDI CC1 adds temporary depth here without
  changing the stored setting.
- **Down, held longer than half a second:** Main controls noise level, X
  selects white or pink noise across a small noon dead zone, and Y is MOD MIX.
- **Preset selection:** hold Down at startup, or hold it for five seconds
  during operation. LED 4 warns after four seconds. Factory voices and only
  populated user slots are available; LED 5 identifies the user bank.
- Soft pickup prevents knob jumps whenever the switch position or oscillator
  page changes.

## Filter, Contours, And Modulation

`Audio Out 1` uses a four-pole resonant ladder filter with accepted low-pass
and high-pass modes. The Web UI supplies cutoff mode, emphasis, filter contour,
independent amplifier and filter ADS controls, independent decay-release
switches, and None/1/3/2/3/Full keyboard tracking.

MOD SRC A selects External OSC3 / CV In2 or Filter Contour. MOD SRC B selects
Noise, external modulation on CV In2, or the internal LFO. MOD MIX crossfades
those sources; MOD DEPTH and pitch/filter balance set their amount and
destination. The internal LFO is free-running, triangle or square, and covers
0.05--14 Hz. Oscillator and filter modulation can be independently enabled.

Glide is preset-backed and acts on the underlying MIDI or 1 V/oct pitch before
modulation. `CV Out 1` follows the same glide, keeping a patched external OSC3
in step with OSC1 and OSC2.

## Inputs And MIDI

- `Audio In 1`: calibrated 1 V/oct pitch CV for OSC1 and OSC2.
- `Audio In 2`: external OSC3 audio return.
- `CV In 1`: positive filter-cutoff modulation.
- `CV In 2`: external OSC3 or other external modulation source.
- `Pulse In 1` and `Pulse In 2`: gate the amplifier and filter contours.
- `Pulse Out 1`: mirrors `Pulse In 1`; `Pulse Out 2` is held low.
- USB MIDI: mono, last-note-wins note on/off, pitch bend at +/-2 semitones,
  and CC1 modulation depth. An active MIDI note takes pitch priority over
  `Audio In 1`; gate sources remain ORed, so a pulse gate can hold a contour
  after MIDI note-off.

## Web MIDI

Serve `web/` locally in Chrome or Edge, connect the card with the Web MIDI
button, then use the complete voice editor, eight factory voices, and eight
named card-backed user slots. The UI can save, recall, duplicate, and delete
user voices, provides a developer MIDI monitor, and polls live card changes
back into the interface. Earlier user slots migrate safely with Glide at zero.

## Release Verification

Release 1.0.0 passed the following Workshop System and Keystep tests:

- OSC1, OSC2, and external OSC3 range/pitch tracking, including glide.
- Harmonic-band transitions and distinct waveform character.
- Low/high-pass filter mode, contour, keyboard tracking, resonance, and ADS.
- White/pink noise, modulation-source routing, internal LFO, and MIDI CC1.
- USB MIDI, calibrated pitch CV, pulse gates, MIDI/CV priority, and pulse
  mirror output.
- Factory/user preset selection, Web MIDI sync, save/recall/delete, and
  persistence across power cycles.

## Build

Set `PICO_SDK_PATH` to a Raspberry Pi Pico SDK checkout, then run:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DPICO_NO_PICOTOOL=1
cmake --build build -j2
```

## Provenance

The initial platform, USB MIDI host support, and lookup-table framework derive
from `Workshop_Computer/releases/101_Gnarly_C1ZZL3` at commit
`bf4ecbbed2f2075a6d008f2cba18f70502593b86`. The inherited code and licence

Cosmik M1N1 uses the ComputerCard framework by Chris Johnson. The bundled
`ComputerCard.h` is the canonical ComputerCard 0.4.0 release under the MIT
